# Preventing Confidential Data Leaks through Nudging

This project introduces a communication platform designed to prevent unauthorized sharing of confidential information using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and behavioral nudges.

## Key Features

- **NLP-Based Message Classification**: Utilizes a BERT-based model trained on the Reuters-21578 dataset to classify messages as Public, Sensitive, or Confidential. This classification is crucial for identifying messages that require user intervention.

- **"Are You Sure?" Nudging Mechanism**: Designed to prompt users before sending potentially sensitive or confidential information. The system employs color-coded nudges:
  - **Red Nudge**: Triggered for confidential information.

  - **Yellow Nudge**: Triggered for sensitive information.

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Implemented using Streamlit, allowing for real-time communication with immediate feedback from the NLP model.

## Results

- **Nudge Effectiveness**: 76.9% of users opted to refrain from sending messages after receiving a nudge.

- **User Misclassification**: Users struggled to differentiate between Sensitive and Confidential information, highlighting the need for improved contextual understanding.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of digital nudges in preventing data leaks by influencing user behavior. The BERT modelâ€™s ability to understand context and the strategic implementation of nudges make this platform a promising tool for enhancing data security.
